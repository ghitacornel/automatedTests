Unitils = testing utility framework 

assertions => easier assert

injections => inject data in private fields for building test context
I REALLY HATE THAT extends UnitilsJUnit4 but fortunately there's no need of them.

IO module - Support for performing IO in tests => easier temporary files and folders
NOT COVERED HERE

and may other helper modules
